It further delves into properties of good contrastiveexplanations as proposed in the survey by Verma et al. [2020].What is contrastive explanation?If I were to ask you why the image below is of a five, whatwould you say? How would you explain why this image contains a five?One way to explain why it is a five is to explain why it isdifferent from the other digits. It is not a six, because thebottom-left corner is not connected to the midsection to form a loop;it is not a nine because there is no complete loop on the top half;etc. However, these types of explanations are not directly answeringthe question, but are instead answering why this is not another digit.Contrastive questions are questions of the form “Why is P the caseand not Q?” or simply “Why P and not Q?” These types ofquestions are natural to people and are sometimes even implicitlydesired, even if only “Why P?” is asked. A contrastive explanationto such a question is one that provides a change to the circumstancessuch that Q would be the case. Q is usually called the foil.For example, suppose Alice is denied a loan. Alice asks the banker“Why was my loan denied?” Here, the foil is implicit and if it wasincluded, Alice would have asked “Why was my loan denied and notaccepted?” Likewise, it would be natural for the banker to give acontrastive explanation as to why the loan was denied. The bankermight say: “If you made $10,000 more per year, your loan would be accepted,”or they might say something like: “If you were at your job for three years instead of two, then yourloan would be accepted.”Each of these explanations may be valid, i.e. truthful, however eachof them may be harder for Alice to act on.Properties of good contrastive examplesThe above example motivates a discussion of the goodness of individualcontrastive examples. Verma et al. [2020] conducted a survey of contrastive examples and found five propertiesthat good contrastive examples exhibit.1. ValidityA contrastive example should be truthful, or valid. If Alice goes toher boss and asks for a raise of $10,000 and they give it to her, sheshould now qualify for the loan. If she would not qualify for the loan(and the bank’s policies hadn’t changed), then the banker would havelied to her. We need valid contrastive examples to empower thosereceiving them and not waste their time.2. ActionabilityIn the above example, each of the actions that Alice can take, eithergetting a raise of $10,000 or staying at her job for another year, maybe more or less doable for her. If Alice is currently making $200,000per year, it would be easier for her to get a raise of $10,000 than ifshe were making $20,000 per year. Further, some explanations (albeitillegal ones) may even ask that she change her race or gender. Thesewould clearly be in-actionable for Alice. Good contrastive examplesprovide feasible paths to changing the situation, while better onestake into account an individual’s preferences on actionability.3. SparsitySuppose Alice is given two contrastive examples: Make $10,000 more per year Make $3,000 more per year, live in this neighborhood, be at your jobfor six more months, serve in the military, …As humans, it is difficult to handle more than a set number of thingsat a time and so a contrastive example that changes a smaller numberof features will be easier to create a mental model around.4. Data (Manifold) closenessUp until this point, I have been succesful in my goal of notintroducing an automated system into this discussion. However, Istruggle to come up with a good human-centered explanation for thisproperty. I now break from using purely human actors in theexplanation and start to use an automated system.Suppose now the banker has gotten tired of accepting and rejecting allof these loan applications and wants to automate the process. Theydecide to build an automated system and use their past accepted andrejected applications in the training process. The banker uses 90% oftheir previous applications to train the system and the remaining 10%of their previous applications to evaluate it. After training, thesystem performs relatively well on the test set with 99% accuracy.Now comes the problem. Suppose Alice is in a peculiar financialsituation, such that none of the data in the training set comes closeto her situation. How can we expect the system to correctly decide ifher loan should be accepted? Simply put, we can’t without knowing moreabout the system, especially because machine learning modelsinherently do not extrapolate well. In the same way, if a contrastiveexplanation would result in features outside of the scope of thetraining data, then we can’t really know whether the contrastiveexample is itself valid.5. CausalityFinally, features of a person’s financial situation are rarelyindependent. Your salary dictates where you can live, what types ofbank accounts you have open, etc. These causal relations need to beaccounted for when providing an explanation. For example, supposeAlice got the raise, but she moved positions within her company to doso. Clearly her salary is directly causally related to her position inthe company, and so we would hope that achieving a higher position inthe company would not invalidate the banker’s explanation.WrapupThank you for reading my first post! I hope that this blog post hasbeen helpful in explaining what contrastive explanations are and whatare some properties that good contrastive examples exhibit.Verma, S., Ai, A., Dickerson, J., and Hines, K. 2020.
